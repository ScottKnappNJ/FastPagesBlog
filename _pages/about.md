Since you are here reading my blog, I figured I'd tell you a little about how I began this journey into Data Science. My entire career has been spent in finance arena with 
the first half in the Interest Rate Derivative world.  That world of swaps and swaptions, caps and floors, and anything else which would cause an unassuming questioner's eyes 
to glaze over after innocently asking 'So, what do you do?'  I spent about a dozen years managing interest rate derivative portfolios and pricing cutting-edge 
structured products for clients to help them hedge their interest rate exposure.  It was an interesting place to be, for an Accounting major, who's last math class 
was Multivariate Calculus, freshmen year of college and without any programming background.  And as interested as I was to dive into the math and coding, back in the 
late 1990's / early 2000's, the paths to learning higher-levels of math, programming skills and financial modeling weren't as easily available as today.  As a result, 
I developed very strong intutions of how models behave by taking a top-down approach to financial modeling which served as a very nice balance to the PhD
math/physics/engineering backgrounds of the quantitative modeling team which tended to look at everything from a bottom-up approach.  But even with this lack of technical
skills, I still was able to develop the ability to identify cutting-edge modeling; implementing the SABR (Stochastic Alpha-Beta-Rho) option model, early after the original paper was published and developed new derivative solutions to hedge mortgage pre-payment risk, dubbed 'Balanced-Guaranteed' products.

After the 2008/09 financial crisis, there was a huge shift in the banking industry in the ability to manage risk, meaning they no longer did, banks simply hedged it away.
This meant a huge contraction in the industry, leaving most positions to be filled by traders with quantitative backgrounds, who could automate trade execution and risk
management.  This led me to move away from the markets and to work with my wife for a few years as we tried to start a franchise business, and then to me taking my 
experience in the finanical markets and starting my own Financial Planning practice.  

The old saying, 'you don't know what you don't know' was never more true, and that first year was filled with starts and stops as I learned the industry and redefined 
what type of practice I wanted to create.  The end result was to be a planning-first practice, which was product and company agnostic, and used deep comprehensive planning
in a variety of areas (Retirement, Investment, Tax, Insurance and Estate) to drive recommendations for the clients.  Over the next few years, I developed a 
great deal of knowledge in all of those areas and experience some levels of success and acquired my CFA certification, but the point came where an unfortunate 
realization had to be made.  This realization was that success in the financial advisory arena, is not determined by the knowledge of your craft or the quality of 
the work you perform, but how well you can sell.  And while I consider myself a very good planner, and a good relatoionship manager, if I'm being honest I am a 
mediocre sales person.  Then the opportunity arose to sell my practice and I had to make that difficult choice of selling.  Then Covid hit.

While job-seeking became difficult, this gave me the opporunity to dive head first into learning to code with a focus on Data Science.  It began with the 10-course 
specialization offered by John Hopkins through Coursera.  This course is taught in the R language, which for me was a great initital foray to learning programming while
dipping my toes into what Data Science encompasses.  From that I've taken a bunch of other online courses, focusing on math: (Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus), 
coding (R, Python, SQL) and in machine learning (ISLR, NLP, deep learning, etc.).  Additionally, I've sprinkled in some Sustainable Investing education, taking a v
ariety of courses offered by PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) and being the first class to earn the Sustainability and Climate Risk certification offered by GARP. 

Now, I'm focusing on a few things.  I'm working through the Deep Learning with fastai book/course, still brushing on some Linear Algebra/Calculus and beginning to put
together some projects.  These projects will be a culmination of all the different skills I've developed over the past few months, focusing on some of the specific 
applications that I've learned in a recent course on Coursera, Investment Management with Python.  There will also be other shorter blog posts about things 
I'm currently learning.  

It hasn't been a straight line, but I do think I'm beginning to converge on the correct path.  And in the end, hopefully this will not all be for nought.  Obviously, the 
near-term goal of all of this is to be able to find a role to in the Data Science world, that I can transition into and best utilize my extensive financial background while
continuing to develop these newly acquired skills.

I hope you enjoy reading about my journey.
