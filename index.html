Welcome to my blog.  This will simply provide me a space to brain drump any interesting topics that I am learning about or working on in the area of Data Science.
This will include markdown documents, where I just talk about the theory and background on various topics.  Or Jupyter Notebooks, where we will work through
the coding behind these topics and which you can download and run yourself.  Or better yet, maybe even a whole research project, that may encompass a variety of 
ideas with some goal in mind.  

With that, I hope you enjoy reading about my journey into Data Science.
