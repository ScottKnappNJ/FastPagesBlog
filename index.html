Welcome to my blog.  This will simply provide me a space to brain drump any interesting topics that I am learning about or working on in the area of Data Science.
This will include markdown documents, where I just talk about the theory and background on various topics.  Or Jupyter Notebooks, where we will work through
the coding behind these topics and which you can download and run yourself.  Or better yet, maybe even a whole research project, that may encompass a variety of 
ideas with some goal in mind.  I'll apologize in advance if there is a bit of code that isn't explained well, or if I happen to jump around a little in my explanations or
for that matter, any grammatical or spelling mistakes.  As these are to be used as brain-dumps for topics which are top of mind for me.  Even so, I hope you enjoy reading 
about my journey into Data Science.
